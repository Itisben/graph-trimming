This is the c++ code for draft paper "Linear Time Parallel Graph Trimming" . The experiments test existing trimming method used by Hong's algorithm (so-called AC1Trim), and our new trimming algorithm (so-called AC6Trim). 

# The structure of the folder

1. ```~/ours-hong-ufscc/``` : include Hong's algorithm (with AC1Trim) and our AC6Tim. 

1. ```~/ours-hong-ufscc/gm_graph/``` : include the library of CSR format storing graph.

1. ```~/ours-hong-ufscc/src/``` : include the c++ source code.

1. ```~/ours-hong-ufscc/tools/``` : include tools for converting common graph to CSR format.

1. ```~/ours-hong-ufscc/tools``` : include the test results on my laptop.

1. ```~/experiments/``` : inlude all the testing scripts.

1. ```~/experiments/graphs``` : inlude implicit BEEM model checking graphs. The explicit graphs are so large that can not uploaded. But they are easy to download from correspounding websites.
